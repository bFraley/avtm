Current main goal:
    Progress to the point where code organization makes sense, all instructions are working properly,
    and basic documentation and how to text is complete.

Related to Core class:
    - Restructure codebase to improve modularity. 
    - Distinguish between parse behavior and instruction calling behavior.
    - Improve on lex/parse base functions in program_step and define them in the Core class.

Instruction Grammar and Syntax:
    - Finalize syntax based rules, command ordering options.
    - Identify opportunities and obstacles for targeting PyPy.
    - Identify opportunities and obstacles for targeting Numpile.

Misc Tasks:
    - Complete initial instruction implementations.   
    - binary search for names lookup.
    - arithmetic operators for the .calc method.
    - complex arithmetic expression parsing.
    - protected (read only)  segments or whole tapes.
    - encryption/decryption for segments or whole tapes.
    - type classes for segments in order to store and manipulate typed data and files in a segment.

TODO:
    - Implement instructions to name, intialize, and load tape(s)
    - Recursive call logic to program_step to correctly deal with
      multiple instructions on a single line.

NOTES: 2016

    8-1) Got basic namespace identifier instruction working for naming
         single frames and or segments - along with ability to lookup
         and  ( .r ) read a frame or segment by name.
