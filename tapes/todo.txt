Current main goal:
    Progress to the point where code organization makes sense, all instructions are working properly,
    and basic documentation and how to text is complete.


GENERAL
- Restructure codebase to improve modularity.
- Distinguish between parse behavior and instruction calling behavior.
- Improve on lex/parse base functions in program_step and define them in the Core class.
- Finalize syntax based rules, command ordering options.
- Identify opportunities and obstacles for targeting PyPy.
- Identify opportunities and obstacles for targeting Numpile.

IMPLEMENT
- Core class    
- binary search for names lookup.
- arithmetic operators for the .calc method.
- complex arithmetic expression parsing.
- protected (read only)  segments or whole tapes.
- encryption/decryption for segments or whole tapes.
- type classes for segments in order to store and manipulate typed data and files in a segment.
